		The next step for coding a website (for me) is to setup the error and 404 pages. The 404 page to be used to display something useful to the user when something cannot be found. A nice error page can also be helpful in debugging and for informing the general public that an error has occurred on your website.

		websites are increasingly becoming more and more dynamically loaded as opposed to a full page download for every page on a website. This website in particular is using Hashbang (shebang) style page loading to make page transitions more seamless; but this presents a problem both with google search and google analytics.  I'll discuss how I manage both of these problems and how you can design a website with seamless page transition as well as tracking these page changes with google analytics.

		For the last year or so I have been on a bit of a diet and exercise routine in order to get myself in shape and more recently I have increased my level of workout and decreased my calorie intake somewhat. A few weeks ago I bought myself a [Fitbit](http://www.fitbit.com) to help me better track my daily exercise and overall fitness level as well as weight and sleeping habits asa bonus. Last week however I started seeing a myriad of reviews and information about the new [Jawbone Up](http://jawbone.com/UP) and was starting to think I might be missing out on something.
